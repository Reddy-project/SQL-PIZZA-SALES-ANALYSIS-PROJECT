# SQL-PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
I’m thrilled to share my first-ever SQL dashboard, which provides an in-depth analysis of 
21,350 total orders to uncover valuable insights into Reddy's pizza sales trends.

Key Objectives
✅ Revenue Insights: Breaking down total revenue generated across different pizza types and sizes.
✅ Quantity Sold: A comprehensive analysis of sales volume, helping understand which pizzas are top-sellers.
✅ Market Growth Trends: Tracking the rise in pizza demand, giving valuable insights into growth patterns and customer preferences.



🍕The Greek Pizza takes the top spot for the highest-priced pizza
🍕Large (18,526 orders) and Small (15,385 orders) pizzas dominate, while XXl size pizzas show
  underperformance with just 28 orders.      
🍕The Classic Deluxe Pizza is at the top with a peak order quantity of 2453
🍕Classic Pizzas are the clear favourite, with 14,888 orders.
🍕Between 11 AM-2 PM, we have seen the peak in the order count and from 9-11 am shows minimal
   activity.
🍕An average daily order count of 138 pizzas highlights a strong shift in customer 
  preferences toward fast food and junk food.                                     	
🍕The Thai Chicken Pizza stands out, generating the highest revenue of $43,434.25.

Changes to do:
🍗Expand Chicken Pizza Varieties: Currently, there are only 6 types of chicken pizzas, yet they generate the highest revenue.
🍕Address Underperforming Sizes: XXL and XL pizzas have the lowest revenue and minimal order counts, pricing adjustments, or bundling offers can help boost their sales.
📈Promote Other Categories: While the Classic Pizza category contributes the highest sales (14,888 orders), focusing on promoting other categories can diversify the change in customer preferences.
